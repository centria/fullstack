## Prerequisites

*"Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, and mastery of basic use of the Git version management system. You are also expected to have perseverance and a capacity for solving problems and seeking information independently.*

*Previous knowledge of JavaScript or other course topics is not required."*

You will be able to do this course without all the prerequisites, but it might require attendance in the lessons. Especially databases might need some hard work.

# Introduction

*"This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.*

*The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data."*

This site is meant for **Full Stack Developent course** in [Centria University of Applied Sciences](https://web.centria.fi/en){:target="_blank"}. The course material is in this [**Full Stack Open course**](https://fullstackopen.com/en), by University of Helsinki. The quotations are from that course page.


## Prerequisites

*"Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, and mastery of basic use of the Git version management system. You are also expected to have perseverance and a capacity for solving problems and seeking information independently.*

*Previous knowledge of JavaScript or other course topics is not required."*

You will be able to do this course without all the prerequisites, but it might require attendance in the lessons. Especially databases might need some hard work.

It is adviced that you have at least some idea of databases, or participate in a database course while doing this course. Such a course is for example [https://centria.fi/courses/databases](https://centria.fi/courses/databases).

## Course instructions in Centria

* To participate to this course, **read this page first.**
* *READ EVERYTHING IN THIS PAGE, BEFORE OPENING ANY LINKS.*
* After you have *read* **all** the instructions, *follow* the instructions **one by one**.

## More instructions

* Read all of the instructions in this page, before opening the links in these: 
* Go to the course page [**https://fullstackopen.com/en/**](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)
* Read this subpage: [**https://fullstackopen.com/en/faq**](https://fullstackopen.com/en/faq), or at least the first 10 questions and answers.
* After you have read those, read this: [**https://fullstackopen.com/en/about**](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about)
* You can start the course from here: [**https://fullstackopen.com/en#course-contents**](https://fullstackopen.com/en#course-contents) by going to Part0.
* You can complete the course by completing all the parts (or at least 0-8) in the course page.

## Even more instructions

* I assume you have read everything so far, and are still on this page.
* When you register to the task submission system in the course, you need to login with your GitHub account.
  * A GitHub account is required to complete the tasks on the course, so it is compulsory to have one.

## Deadlines

* The course does not have internal deadlines, but it is adviced to do the parts during the course weeks. Doing all at once is not reasonable or sane.
* If you want to have credits to Centria, you have to have all the parts (or at least parts 0 to 8) completed by:
  * **6.12.2020 at 23:59:59**. 
  * **9.1.2021 at 23:59:59**. 
  * **28.2.2021 at 23:59:59** (pending). 
  * TBA
* The course is graded only on these dates. If you submit your completion before the first one, the course will be credited on 6.12.2020. If you submit your completion after a date on the list, the course will be credited on the next possible date on the list.

## Support and Help

If you want help with the exercises:

*"You can discuss the course and related topics in our dedicated group on Telegram: [https://t.me/fullstackcourse](https://t.me/fullstackcourse). Please join the conversation!"* 

The channel is for the Fullstackopen course, and is not provided by Centria. In the channel you can ask and give help to/from your peers, as well as the course instructors.

Telegram requires registeration with a valid telephone number which can receive SMS-messages.

## How to get credits in Centria

* Contact the course teacher.
  * Send an email (to heikki . ahonen at centria . fi) from *your Centria email address*. 
    * In the topic include the words *"Fullstack credits"*
    * In the message include the *url to the repository (repositories) you used on the course*.
      * They need to be public, or access rights need to be given to GitHub user *HeikkiHei*.
    * In the message include the *unique url of your course certificate*.
      * You can get the certificate after you have completed the course.
    * Remember to sign your email with your name, as well.
* You will get 8 credits by doing the parts from 0 to 8. 
  * Parts 9 and 10 are voluntary, but *highly recommended* and very useful.
  * You can still get credits for them, according to your certificate.
* For Centria credits, you *DO NOT* need to do the Open University Exam, but you are welcome to do so.
* On the University of Helsinki page are instructions of how to get credits through Open University of Helsinki. If you have credits through that, send an email and let's see compensatory credits.

## Where to begin?

This part is the exception to the rule. These links should be opened before starting the actual course. **These are voluntary** and *are not submitted anywhere*, but do help and are a good intro to or recap of basics.

* If you haven't done any web development before, start with these exercises from another University of Helsinki course: [**https://tkt-lapio.github.io/websites/**](https://tkt-lapio.github.io/websites/). 
  * This will give you a little idea of how HTML works, at least, and how web pages have been done for ages.
* Also read this [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) to get some information about MVC, a web-design for the ages. 
  * You can also watch a YouTube-video about it, something like this: [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUg2SWWK18I**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUg2SWWK18I).
* If you have never heard of databases and MongoDB, try this: [**https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about**](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about), before doing this course. It might be a good idea anyways, to refresh your memory.
  * If you are doing or have done Relational Databases & SQL course, you will get enought database knowledge from said course.
  * The database used in this course **is not** relational or SQL, so you might still want to explore some basics of MongoDB.
* You can now start opening the links and reading the material from those, **IN ORDER**.
